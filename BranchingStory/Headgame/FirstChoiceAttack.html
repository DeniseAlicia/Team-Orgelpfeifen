<h2><strong>Attack!</strong></h2>
<img src="../Images/Attack.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="350">
<p>Your opponent jumps towards you and is about to hit you. <br>
    The best thing you can do is defintly to be faster than him. <br>
    You clenche your right hand to a fist and raise your arm to strike him down. <br>
    In that second you feel his fist hitting you and knocking your off of your feet. <br>
    Probably attack is not always the best defense. <br>
    You hear the people screaming your opponents name. You feel anger burning in your venes. <br>
    This should be your fight not his! <br>
    You get up again and the referee gives the signal for the next round. <br>
    What are you going to do? <br>
