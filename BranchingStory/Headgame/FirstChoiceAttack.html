            Your opponent jumps towards you and is about to hit you.
            <br>
            The best thing you can do is defintly to be faster than him.
            <br>
            You clenche your right hand to a fist and raise your arm to strike him down.
            <br>
            In that second you feel his fist hitting you and knocking your off of your feet.
            <br>
            Probably attack is not always the best defense.
            <br>
            You hear the people screaming your opponents name. You feel anger burning in your venes.
            <br>
            This should be your fight not his!
            <br>
            You get up again and the referee gives the signal for the next round.
            <br>
            What are you going to do?
