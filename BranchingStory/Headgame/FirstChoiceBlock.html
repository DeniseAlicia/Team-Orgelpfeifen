            Your opponent jumps towards you and is about to hit you.
            <br>
            You wont be fast enough to evade.
            <br>
            You raise your arms to block his incoming attack.
            <br>
            You hear the audience screaming your name. This was an excellent parade.
            <br>
            But the fight isn't over yet!
            <br>
            You get ready and the referee gives the signal for the next round.
            <br>
            What are you going to do?
