        Having his attack blocked,

        he fails to raise his arms in time to defend against 
        <br>
        any possible response you might throw at him.
        <br>
        Unluckily you dont miss a beat and respond in the nick of time

        <p>
        having successfully shoved your right fist into his face,
        <br>
        you send him plummeting into the Mat.
        <br>
        With his mouthgard down his own throat,
        <br>
        your opponent is out cold.
        <br>
        <br>
        Seeing his lifeless eyes the ref doesn't even start counting
        <br>
        and you are declared the Winner!
