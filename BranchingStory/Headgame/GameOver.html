                In a moment of carelessnes, you let your guard down. 
                <br>
                Your opponent sees an opening and nails you with a punch to the jaw,
                <br>
                knocking you out. 
                <br>
                As your consciousness fades, you hear the crowd cheering.
                <br>
                But not for you...
