<h2><strong>Block!</strong></h2>
<img src="Images/Block.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400">
<p>Your opponent jumps towards you and is about to hit you. <br>
    You wont be fast enough to evade. <br>
    You raise your arms to block his incoming attack. <br>
    You hear the audience screaming your name. This was an excellent parade. <br>
    But the fight isn't over yet! <br>
    You get ready and the referee gives the signal for the next round. <br>
    What are you going to do? <br>
