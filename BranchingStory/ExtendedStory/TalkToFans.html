        <h4> You stop and wait for them to catch up with to you.</h4>
        <p>
            One of them starts talking to you. "We saw you fight. You're really an incredible fighter." <br>
            He looks at you with excitement in his eyes. <br>
            "Do you think it's even possible to become better?"<br>
            You don't have to think about that answer: <br>
            "You can always be better!"<br>
            Now one of the others starts talking too:<br>
            "BUt what do you want to do then?"<br>
        </p>

            <p>"What i want to do with my future?"</p>

            <p> "Yes. So what are you plans for the future. Do you want to keep fighting and getting better or not?" <br> 
            </p>

            <p> How do you answer his question?</p>
