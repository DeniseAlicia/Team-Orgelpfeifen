    <h2>Your choice, make a decision now!</h2>

    <p>
        You approach each other, as you face each other, looking into each other's eyes.
        <br>
        Suddenly, a sweat drop flows from your forhead into your left eye.
        <br>
        Your left eye burns, and you close it.
        <br>
        Even thought it was only a millisecond, your opponent notices. 
        <br>
        He wants to take advantage of the oppurtunity to land first blow.
