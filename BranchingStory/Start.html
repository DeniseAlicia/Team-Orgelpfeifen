                You approach each other, as you face each other, looking into each other's eyes.
                <br>
                Suddenly, a sweat drop flows from your forhead into your left eye.
                <br>
                Your left eye burns, and you close it.
                <br>
                Even thought it was only a millisecond, your opponent notices. 
                <br>
                He wants to take advantage of the oppurtunity to land first blow.
